World today is drowning in information and is starving for Knowledge. This is where Data Science and Machine Learning come to rescue. Now it's our turn to be in tune with the latest technology and make use of it in solving real world problems and feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction at the end of the day. 

I am Geetha and i did start my journey as a Data Science practitioner with IBM and i must say it's a very rough journey learning new things is always intimidating but what's fun to stay the same and do the same?

## **Little bit about the Programme**


The program consists of 9 online courses that will provide you with the **latest job-ready tools and skills**, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. You’ll learn data science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.


## **Applied Learning Project**

This Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on applied learning. Except for the first course, all other courses include a series of hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud that will give you **practical skills with applicability to real jobs**, including:

**Tools:** Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, and Watson Studio

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.

**Projects:** random album generator, predict housing prices, best classifier model, battle of neighborhoods
